# Implementation Status and Fit-Gap Report (Archived)

This report has been intentionally retired as a live source of truth.

Why:
- It became high-noise for agents.
- Point-in-time fit-gap matrices drift quickly.
- Current behavior is better represented by tests + concise operator docs.

Use instead:
- `AGENTS.md` for agent workflow and command truth
- `docs/TECH.md` for current runtime/query contracts
- `tests/unit/*` for executable behavior guarantees

For historical analysis, use git history.
