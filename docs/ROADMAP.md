# Roadmap (Current)

This file is intentionally short.

Historical planning detail was removed to reduce agent noise.
Use git history for past roadmap versions.

## Active Priorities

1. Keep deterministic query paths reliable (`structure`, guarded direct lookups, scoped asks).
2. Improve retrieval quality only when it produces user-visible trust gains.
3. Maintain CLI ergonomics (`pal` first, explicit scope parity, script-safe quiet behavior).
4. Keep docs/tests synchronized with actual command behavior.

## Not Tracked Here

- One-off implementation diaries
- Superseded design debates
- Fine-grained internal pseudocode

For operating behavior, see `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, and `docs/TECH.md`.
