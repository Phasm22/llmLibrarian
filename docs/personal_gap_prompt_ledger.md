Prompt-level state tracking across incremental changes.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Random-01 | Cross-silo answer collapses to OpenClaw/WhatsApp | Unified retrieval overweights large silos | A2 | Multi-silo evidence appears in final answer | OpenClaw-only recurring bugs answer | Low confidence: unified search found weak or uneven evidence across silos. Try narrowing by silo/time/type or splitting into sub-questions. | steady | 100 | 100 | 0 | steady | /Users/tjm4/llmLibrarian/docs/personal_gap_focus_run.md |

| Random-03 | Single-silo collapse on cross-silo ask | Unified analytical path lacked fan-out + minimum silo coverage | B2 | Uses at least 3 silos when available, else explicit concentration note | OpenClaw-heavy / weak-theme response | Low confidence: unified search found weak or uneven evidence across silos.

| Random-05 | Body tone over-hedges despite confidence banner | Banner already carries uncertainty; body needs direct findings | B1 | Banner remains; body removes repeated hedge loops | OpenClaw-heavy automation answer | Low confidence: unified search found weak or uneven evidence across silos.

| Random-09 | Good style but weak context mix | Unified retrieval still biased to one silo | A2 | Better cross-silo context selection | Mostly OpenClaw unfinished-work answer | Low confidence: unified search found weak or uneven evidence across silos.

| Random-11 | Timeline/abandon reasoning underuses metadata cues | Add weak mtime recency hints (never sole evidence) | B3 | Recency hints appear as weak signal, no timestamp-only claims | [dry-run] | Low confidence: query is weakly related to indexed content. | steady | 48 | 48 | 0 | steady | /Users/tjm4/llmLibrarian/docs/personal_gap_focus_run.md |
| Random-12 | Still not fully unified across silos | Enforce min silo coverage and silo-grouped context | B2 | Cross-silo context usually includes >=3 silos when available | [dry-run] | Low confidence: unified search found weak or uneven evidence across silos.
